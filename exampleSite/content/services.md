1. Cloud Infrastructure Design & Migration

   - Architecture and rollout of multi-cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP)
   - Landing-zone setup with secure, scalable foundations

2. Infrastructure as Code & Automation

   - Terraform/Terragrunt pipelines for repeatable deployments
   - Configuration management with Ansible and Python scripts
   - Policy-as-Code governance to enforce security and compliance

3. CI/CD Pipeline Development

   - End-to-end build, test and deploy automation using GitLab, Jenkins, Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions
   - GitOps workflows with ArgoCD or n8n for self-service developer platforms

4. Containerization & Orchestration

   - Docker container design and optimization
   - Kubernetes cluster architecture, Helm chart development and management

5. Monitoring, Observability & Reliability

   - Implementation of Prometheus, Grafana, ELK and cloud-native monitoring stacks
   - Alerting, dashboards and SLO/SLA setups to ensure high availability

6. Cloud-Native Application & Microservices Development

   - Backend microservices in Go, Python or TypeScript with gRPC/REST interfaces
   - Serverless and container-based AI/ML feature integration (Azure AI/ML, Databricks)
   - IoT backend solutions with real-time data ingestion and processing

7. Data Platform & Analytics

   - Designing data pipelines on Databricks and other big-data platforms
   - Database schema design and performance tuning (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MS SQL)

8. Security, Compliance & Governance

   - Secure-by-default environment hardening
   - Role-based access control, network segmentation and encryption strategies

9. Developer Experience & Platform Evangelism

   - Building internal developer portals and toolchains
   - Training, workshops and documentation to drive platform adoption

10. Mentoring, Training & Team Enablement

   - Hands-on coaching in DevOps best practices
   - Establishing CI/CD, testing and release management standards
   - Promoting a culture of collaboration, continuous improvement and security

11. AI & LLM Infrastructure as Code

   - Provisioning Azure AI infrastructure (Azure Machine Learning, Azure Databricks, Azure Foundry) via Terraform/ARM/Bicep
   - Managing model lifecycle: releases, rollbacks and upgrades in Azure Foundry and Azure OpenAI Service
   - Automating quota assignments, regional availability and guardrails (prompt filters, usage limits) for LLM deployments
   - Instrumenting monitoring and observability (Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, custom Prometheus/Grafana pipelines) for AI workloads
   - Designing secure connectivity and networking (VNET peering, Private Link, managed identities, Key Vaults) for LLM-consuming applications
