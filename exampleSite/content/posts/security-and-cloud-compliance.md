## Use Case: Automating Security Policy Enforcement in Azure

### Scenario

A regulated enterprise must ensure all resources in Azure comply with strict security standards (e.g., encryption, network isolation, RBAC). Manual enforcement is error-prone and not scalable. The objective is to implement policy-as-code for automated, auditable compliance.

### Solution Overview

1. **Define Azure Policies as Code** using Terraform.
2. **Assign RBAC roles and integrate with Entra ID** for identity management.
3. **Automate compliance checks** with a Python script and trigger remediation.

#### Step 1: Define Azure Policy with Terraform

```hcl
resource "azurerm_policy_definition" "deny_public_ip" {
  name         = "deny-public-ip"
  policy_type  = "Custom"
  mode         = "All"
  display_name = "Deny Public IP Assignment"
  policy_rule  = <<POLICY
{
  "if": {
    "field": "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/ipAddress",
    "notEquals": null
  },
  "then": {
    "effect": "deny"
  }
}
POLICY
}

resource "azurerm_policy_assignment" "deny_public_ip" {
  name                 = "deny-public-ip-assignment"
  scope                = azurerm_resource_group.rg.id
  policy_definition_id = azurerm_policy_definition.deny_public_ip.id
}
```

#### Step 2: RBAC Assignment and Entra ID Integration

```hcl
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "aks_admin" {
  scope                = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.aks.id
  role_definition_name = "Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin"
  principal_id         = azuread_user.engineer.object_id
}
```

#### Step 3: Automated Compliance Check with Python

```python
import requests

# Example: Check Azure resources for non-compliance
def check_non_compliant_resources(subscription_id, access_token):
    url = f"https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/policyStates/latest/queryResults?api-version=2019-10-01"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json={})
    data = response.json()
    for result in data.get("value", []):
        if result["complianceState"] == "NonCompliant":
            print(f"Non-compliant: {result['resourceId']}")

# Usage: check_non_compliant_resources(subscription_id, access_token)
```

#### Step 4: Remediation Automation

Set up automation (e.g., Azure Functions or CI/CD jobs) to trigger remediation scripts when non-compliance is detected.

### Key Takeaways

- **Policy-as-Code**: Codify and enforce security requirements with Terraform.
- **Automated Compliance**: Detect and remediate drift using Python and Azure APIs.
- **RBAC Integration**: Use Entra ID for secure, manageable access.

This approach ensures scalable, auditable, and continuous security compliance in the cloud.
