## Use Case: Automating Azure Landing Zone Deployment with Terraform and GitLab CI/CD

### Scenario

A financial services company needed to accelerate its cloud adoption while ensuring strict security and compliance requirements. The challenge was to deploy a secure, modular Azure Landing Zone that could be reused across projects and environments, with full automation and auditability.

### Solution Overview

1. **Design modular Terraform code** for the landing zone (networking, security, identity).
2. **Store code in GitLab** for version control and collaboration.
3. **Automate deployment** with GitLab CI/CD, enforcing policy guardrails and RBAC.
4. **Enable repeatability** for development, staging, and production.

### Example: Terraform Module for Azure Virtual Network

```hcl
# modules/network/main.tf
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
  name                = var.name
  address_space       = var.address_space
  location            = var.location
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "subnet" {
  name                 = var.subnet_name
  resource_group_name  = var.resource_group_name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.name
  address_prefixes     = var.subnet_prefixes
}
```

### Example: GitLab CI/CD Pipeline for Terraform

```yaml
stages:
  - validate
  - plan
  - apply

validate:
  image: hashicorp/terraform:1.5
  script:
    - terraform init
    - terraform validate

plan:
  image: hashicorp/terraform:1.5
  script:
    - terraform plan -out=tfplan
  dependencies:
    - validate
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - tfplan

apply:
  image: hashicorp/terraform:1.5
  script:
    - terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
  when: manual
  dependencies:
    - plan
```

### Key Takeaways

- **Modularity**: Build reusable Terraform modules for networking, security, and identity.
- **Automation**: Use CI/CD pipelines for validation, planning, and controlled deployment.
- **Compliance**: Enforce policy guardrails and RBAC as code.

This approach resulted in faster, safer cloud deployments and reduced operational overhead.
